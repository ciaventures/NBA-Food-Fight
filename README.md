NBA Food Fight
=================

NBA Food Fight is a game developed as a capstone project in a Full-Stack Javascript Course at the Portland Code School. The game allows you to play along with in-arena food promotions awards at NBA games with people in the stadium. The application retrives box score and scheduling data from xmlstats.com to provide a calendar data and results.
<br /></br />
The application was developed on a node.js / express.js back-end and with a backbone.js front-end. The back-end's entry point is server.js, and the front-end's entry point is main.js (which loads app.js using require.js).
<br /><br />
A demo of the application is available at <a href="http://nba-food-fight.herokuapp.com">http://nba-food-fight.herokuapp.com</a>. To view user functionality, you can log in with a demo user account using:  <br /> <div style="text-align:center"> **Username**: lotsa<br /> **Password**: food </div> <br />
**Note**: many of the features may not work properly in the offseason (or late in the postseason). Demo of application available for display in the offseason available at <a href="http://nba-food-fight.herokuapp.com">http://nba-food-fight.herokuapp.com</a>.
